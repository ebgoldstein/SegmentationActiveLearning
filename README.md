# Segmentation Active Learning

This is a repository of notebooks and code describing some experiments in active learning of segmentations for NOAA post storm images.

It is genetically related to the repository for active learning in [classification](https://github.com/ebgoldstein/WashoverML_Active_Learning)

The notebooks focus on performing inference with a trained model made using [Segmentation Zoo](https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/segmentation_zoo). and determining which images should be labeled next using [Dash Doodler](https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/dash_doodler)
